# NeRF_implementation

This is my implementation of [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) by PyTorch. Thanks to this [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/its-nerf-from-nothing-build-a-vanilla-nerf-with-pytorch-7846e4c45666) and this [blog](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/11/10/computer-graphics-and-deep-learning-with-nerf-using-tensorflow-and-keras-part-1/).
